### IPv4

IPv4 is the fourth version of the internet protocol (IP).

IPv4 addresses are 32-bit integers that can be expressed in hexadecimal notation. The format is x.x.x.x, where each x can be any value between 0 and 255.

IPv4 still routes most of today’s internet traffic. A 32-bit address space limits the number of unique hosts to 2^32, which is 4,294,967,296 IPv4 addresses for the world to use.

### IPv4 vs IPv6

IPv6 is the sixth version of the internet protocol (IP).

IPv6 moves from 32 bits to a 128-bit address space, with both letters and numbers in identifiers (for example, 2002:db8::8a3f:362:7897). IPv6 has 2^128 uniquely identifying addresses, which is about 340 undecillion.

The key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 are:
- IPv4 is 32-Bit IP address whereas IPv6 is a 128-Bit IP address.
- IPv4 is a numeric addressing method whereas IPv6 is an alphanumeric addressing method.
- IPv4 binary bits are separated by a dot(.) whereas IPv6 binary bits are separated by a colon(:).
- IPv4 offers 12 header fields whereas IPv6 offers 8 header fields.
- IPv4 supports broadcast whereas IPv6 doesn’t support broadcast.
- IPv4 has checksum fields while IPv6 doesn’t have checksum fields
- IPv4 supports VLSM (Virtual Length Subnet Mask) whereas IPv6 doesn’t support VLSM.
- IPv4 uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to map to MAC address whereas IPv6 uses NDP (Neighbour Discovery Protocol) to map to MAC address.
